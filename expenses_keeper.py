# This simple python script is a tool to help keep track of expenses. I needed a way to quickly categorize and add
# expenses so I wrote this. I tried to be as explicit and clear as I could as I intend to use this as a learning tool
# for new programmers.
#
#   The format of the expenses file is:
#
#       Header Line : In the format: Date, Description, Category 1, Category 2, Category ..., Category N
#       Expense 1   : Amount lies in some category
#       Expense 2   : Amount lies in some category
#       Expense ... : Amount lies in some category
#       Expense N   : Amount lies in some category
#
#       An example of a file might look like:
#
#       Date	Description	          Rent    	Groceries	Utilities	Gas	   Healthcare	Shopping	
#       01/01/19	Doctor													   150.0                
#       01/01/19	Rent			  1250.0								                          
#       01/02/19	Electric								   55.0							          
#       01/02/19	Gas										            10.0	                          
#       01/02/19	Groceries					  120.58				                                  
#       01/02/19	Clothing												                 23.0   													                               
# 
# Recall that Python is interpreted. This means that each time a file is read, functions that are used must be
# already defined. For this script, this simply means that the file should be read from bottom to top to 
# understand it best.
